  A ClusterServiceVersion(CSV) represents a particular version of a ClusterService and its operator. It includes metadata such as name, description, version, repository link, labels, icon, etc. It declares `owned`/`required` CRDs, cluster requirements, and install strategy that tells OLM how to create required resources and set up the operator as a [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

Note to team: Need a better definition of CSV than it "represents a particular version of ClusterService and it's operator". The word ClusterService doesn't mean anything to someone who hasn't been in the room with the people discussing what a ClusterService is.
