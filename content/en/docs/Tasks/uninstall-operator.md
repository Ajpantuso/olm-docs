  In order to uninstall an operator, you need to delete the following resources:

    - Subscription
    - ClusterServiceVersion (CSV)

    Both `Subscription` and `CSV` are namespaced objects meaning you need to delete a `Subscription` and a `CSV` in a specific namespace where you install the operator into.
---

## Delete a Subscription

If you wish to look up a list of `Subscription` in a specific namespace to see which `Subscription` you want to delete, you can use the following `kubectl` command:
```bash
$ kubectl get subscription -n <namespace>
```

You can delete the `Subscription` in the namespace that the operator was installed into using this command:
```bash
$ kubectl delete subscription <subscription-name> -n <namespace>
```

## Delete a ClusterServiceVersion (CSV)

If you wish to look up a list of `ClusterServiceVersion` in a specific namespace to see which `ClusterServiceVersion` you need to delete, you can use the example `kubectl` command:

```bash
$ kubectl get clusterserviceversion -n <namespace>
```

You can delete the `ClusterServiceVersion` in the namespace that the operator was installed into using this command:

```bash
$ kubectl delete clusterserviceversion <csv-name> -n <namespace>
```

By deleting `ClusterServiceVersion`, it will delete the operator's resources that OLM created for the operator such as deployment, pod(s), RBAC, and others. However, `CustomResourceDefinition` (CRD), that is installed by the operator, won't get deleted during uninstalling process. Deleting `CRD` will resolve into deleting all instances of that `CRD` which may be used by other operators. `CRD` can be deleted manually if needed. Furthermore, deleting a `CSV` also deletes any corresponding CSVs that OLM "Copied" into other namespaces watched by the operator.

Alternatively, you can delete both `Subscription` and its `CSV` using a sequence of commands:
```bash
$ CSV=kubectl delete subscription <subscription-name> -n <namespace> -o json | jq '.status.installedCSV'
$ kubectl delete subscription <subscription-name> -n <namespace>
$ kubectl delete csv $CSV -n <namespace>
```
